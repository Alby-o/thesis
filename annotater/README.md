# Thesis Project
Approach: 

We want to be able to pass through annotations without having to modify the compiler itself. That is what this project is for. 

1. Compile the c file as is to assembly output
2. 

## To-Do

- [x] open file
- [x] compile file as-is
- [x] parse file for annotations
- [x] insert inline assembly where needed
- [x] recompile / compare outputs
