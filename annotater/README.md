# Thesis Project
Approach: 

We want to be able to pass through annotations without having to modify the compiler itself. That is what this project is for. 

1. Compile the c file as is to assembly output
2. 

## To-Do

- [x] open file
- [x] compile file as-is
- [ ] parse file for annotations
- [ ] insert inline assembly where needed
- [ ] recompile / compare outputs
