\section{Approach}
The approach was set out by first analysing existing methods of preserving annotations through intermediate representations. These include the:
\begin{itemize}
    \item compCert Verified C Compiler, 
    \item GNU Extension for Extended Inline Assembly, and
    \item Modifying the LLVM compiler to preserve annotations throughout intermediate representations.
\end{itemize}

Each of these approaches will be analysed individually for viability across each of the test cases outlined in section \ref{subsec:testCases}. For approaches that pass all necessary test cases, a further analysis will be conducted into its suitability and development of any necessary tools to assist in the preservation technique, as outlined in sections \ref{subsec:qualityAnalysis} and \ref{subsec:toolDevelopment}. Finally, an analysis on the runtime efficiency of the program will be conducted to assess the success of the annotations with various levels of optimisation. The approach for this analysis is outlined in \ref{subsec:runtimeEfficiencyOptimisation}.

\subsection{Test Cases}
\label{subsec:testCases}
A suite of test C programs (See Appendix \ref{app:testPrograms}) were created to assist in guiding the process of evaluating each approach as a possible means of preserving annotations. Each program has inline comments documenting the annotation that should be preserved and its location within the program. Additionally, each program aims to test a separate element required to perform a static wpif analysis. Namely, these are to preserve the following through to the assembly output:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item comments,
    \item simple and complex variables (e.g. struct elements and volatile global variables),
    \item security policies,
    \item predicates on the initial state, and
    \item loop invariants.
\end{enumerate}

Each test was conducted to assess the viability of each approach of preserving annotations. If the approach cannot preserve all the required annotations described in the aforementioned list, then it is not viable for a wpif analysis and another technique must be explored.

The justification for each of the test files are as follows:

\miniheading{comment.c}
This test case is primarily a stepping stone to testing more complex scenarios. Here we have a generic comment "critical comment" and we are looking to preserve it through to the assembly. As well as preserving the comment itself, the location of the comment within the source code is to be preserved.

\miniheading{variable.c}
The test file \textit{variable.c} builds off \textit{comment.c}, however, we are additionally looking to preserve annotations about local variables within the program. Here multiple variable types are tested:

\begin{itemize}
    \item int,
    \item char,
    \item unsigned int,
    \item short,
    \item long,
    \item float, and
    \item double.
\end{itemize}

With each of these variables their type data is included as an annotation. This test is particularly interesting as with higher levels of optimisation we can observe how the annotations behave when a variable is optimised out.

\miniheading{volatile.c}
This test program looks at how the technique handles volatile variables. A variable declared as volatile tells the program its value could change unexpectedly. This is especially important when dealing with concurrent programs. If the technique cannot handle volatile variables it is unable to be used for a wpif analysis.

\miniheading{loop.c}
This test program tests how the annotator handles loops and loop invariants. It contains security policies, predicates on the initial state and loop invariants.

\miniheading{rooster.c}
The test program, \textit{rooster.c} delves into a more complex program, combining several features of the previous tests. It contains annotations within functions and global variables.

\miniheading{password.c}
This program tests how annotations are preserved within structs, a user-defined data type. Additionally, \textit{password.c} is a more complex program with multiple functions.

\miniheading{deadStoreElimination.c}
Testing dead store elimination is a bit more complex, as it requires comparing the compiled output before and after compiler optimisations are turned on. Here, the test program simulates the program described in section \ref{subsec:compilersSecurity}.

\miniheading{pread.c}
The program \textit{pread.c} is a culmination of all the previous test cases, and is similar to \textit{loop.c}, however, the global variables within it are volatile. It requires all the necessary components for a wpif analysis.

\subsection{Quality Analysis}
\label{subsec:qualityAnalysis}
Although a method of preserving c annotations may be able to successfully pass all the test cases, it is important to avoid modifying the compiled assembly or binary output. The reason for performing a static analysis on the compiled output is due to the optimisations performed by the compiler. As such, it is important to ensure that preserved annotations do not remove or undo any optimisations
